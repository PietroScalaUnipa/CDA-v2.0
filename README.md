# ABA Metrics

To obtain linear rates using the ABA approach, the average shoreline displacement is calculated by dividing the area bounded by the transects, shoreline and baseline, by the length of the shoreline between two different transects. This simple geometric ratio is then used to calculate by the plug-in further average rates of shoreline change, including M-NSM [m], M-SCE [m], M-EPR [m/time] and M-LRR [m/time].
